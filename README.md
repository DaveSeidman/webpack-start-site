# webpack-start-site

Start by installing all dependencies: 
`npm i`

Then you can run development like this:
`npm run dev`
This will run webpack-dev-server where you can test things out in the browser at http://localhost:8080


And when you're ready to host it live:
`npm run build`
This will webpack all your files into the dist folder after which you can host them somewhere.
